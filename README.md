# Arduino Fast Clock
This project is an Arduino based Fast Clock implementation.  Typically used in model railroading, this fast clock runs faster than an ordinary clock.  You can specify exactly how has you want it to run..  For example, if set to a 2:1 ratio, it will advance 2 minutes for every 1 real minute.  When set to 10:1, it will advance 10 minutes for every 1 real minute.  Or stated anoter way, it will advance one minute every 6 real seconds.

The code has not been posted yet, but should be here by the beginning of April 2018.  Please come back at a later date.
