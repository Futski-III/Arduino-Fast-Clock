## How to install the libraries from GitHub

It's actually very easy to install libraries from Github.  So I'll walk you though it.

1. Click the **"Get it here on GitHub"** link (or goto Github.com and search for the library name)
1. Click the Green **"Clone or Download"** button
1. Select Download ZIP.  Make sure you know where your file gets downloaded to.  You'll need to know that.  It'll usually be in you download folder.
1. Open Arduino
1. From the Arduino menu, select Sketch / Include Library / Add Zip Library
1. Navigate to the folder where you downloaded the library.  This is probably the **"Downloads"** folder.
1. Find the library to add and click it.  It's name will appear in the file name box.  
1. Click Open
1. You're Done
1. Close and Re-open Arduino just to make sure Arduino finds if for your project.
